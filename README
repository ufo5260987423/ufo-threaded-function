# Overview

This package contains threaded-map, threaded-vector-map and such threaded functions for chez scheme. And my purpose is making this library easily imported into other code.

This package is published with Akku(https://akkuscm.org/), which is a language package manager for Scheme. 

This package has been tested with Chez Scheme versions 9.4 and 9.5.

# TODO



# Requirement 

This package uses chez scheme's FFI to call up the pipe() and poll() system calls.  It therefore requires a UNIX-like operating system to function correctly.  It has been tested with linux and should work on the BSDs and on Mac OS X. If using OS X, the glibtool package will be required.

This package also requires chez scheme to have been compiled with the --threads option.

# API
Usage please refer to tests/test-ufo-thread-pool.sps.

1. (threaded-map proc list1 list2 ...) => list
2. (threaded-vector -map proc list1 list2 ...) =>vector
3. (pool-size-ref) => default thread pool size
4. (pool-size-add positive-or-negative-integer )
